        <h1>Can I Call You Rose?</h1>
        <h3>Song by Thee Sacred Souls</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?) <br>
            'Cause you're sweet like a flower in bloom (can I call you Rose?) <br>
            Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?) <br>
            'Cause your fragrance takes over the room (can I call you Rose?), darling</p>
        <p>I wanna plant you in my heart, oh <br>
            So love can grow</p>
        <p>Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?) <br>
            'Cause your thorns won't let love in too soon (can I call you Rose?) <br>
            Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?) <br>
            'Cause your roots have the power to consume (can I call you Rose?) me</p>
        <p>I wanna plant you in my heart, oh <br>
            So love can grow</p>
        <p>I was meditating on loving you and roses and <br>
            The universe told me, "Put it in a love song" <br>
            (Put it in a love, put it in a love, put it in a love song) oh, Rose <br>
            (Put it in a love, put it in a love, put it in a love song) oh, Rose</p>
        <p>(Put it in a love, put it in a love, put it in a love song) <br>
            (Put it in a love, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
            Won't you let me in your heart? <br>
            (Put it in a love, put it in a love, put it in a love song) your heart <br>
            (Put it in a love, put it in a love, put it in a love song) oh, your heart <br>
            (Put it in a love, put it in a love, put it in a love song) <br>
            (Put it in a love, put it in a love, put it in a love song)</p>
        <p>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
            Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
            Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh <br>
            Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh <br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh <br>
            Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh <br>
            Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh</p>
